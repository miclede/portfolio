### Welcome!

My name is Michael, I am a seasoned game developer with a passion for crafting immersive experiences since 2013. Throughout my journey, I have honed my skills in utilizing company custom frameworks while seamlessly collaborating with diverse teams in both QA, Design and in joint development infrastructure.

My expertise lies in the utilization of C# scripting and Unity, where I have demonstrated proficiency in various aspects such as animation and Mecanim animator, sound design, and audio mixer manipulation, UI development in both canvas and 3D space, shader graphs, scriptable objects, render pipelines, as well as adeptness in path finding algorithms and AI control.

With a strong foundation in these areas, I consistently strive to push the boundaries of creativity and technical innovation, delivering compelling gaming experiences that captivate and engage audiences. 

Having spent most of my life in front of my computer screen, both in creating and playing games, I would consider myself having a rather unique perspective when it comes to the industry of game development.

Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to bring your gaming visions to life.
