## Welcome,

My name is Michael, I am a game developer and programmer that specializes in C# based projects within the Unity engine. Working within Unity has been a professional venture of mine for 2 years and a hobby preceding those for the last 10 years. Before coming to settle down in game development, I delivered chinese food, worked in construction, (manual labor for general contractor) and later web development. My experiences have led me to be efficient with all forms of technology and I personally find myself to be proficient in HTML, CSS, Java Script, C#, and Java as programming languages. Below you can find some gif examples of my most recent professional work and further details on my Unity based abilities on the resume page of this site (as well as some gifs of other projects I have worked on) please feel free to reach out to me with any questions related to my work or experience.

Here are some of the projects I worked on while at [Blok.Party](www.linkedin.com/company/blok-party)
