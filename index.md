### Welcome!

My name is Michael, I am a game developer and programmer that specializes in C# based projects within the Unity engine. For the last 10 years I have been working within Unity as both a hobby and profession; back when we used naked prefabs in place of scriptable objects and people still talked about MonoDevelop. My experiences have led me to be efficient with all forms of technology and I personally find myself to be proficient with: HTML, CSS, JS, C#, and Java programming languages. Below you can find some gif examples of my most recent professional work and further details on my Unity based abilities on the resume page of this site (as well as some more gifs) please feel free to reach out to me with any questions related to my work or experience.

Here are some of the projects I worked on while at [Blok.Party.](www.linkedin.com/company/blok-party)
